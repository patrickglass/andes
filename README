ANalytics Database Encrypted System
-----------------------------------

This project is meant to be an educational experiment to learn the insides of
a in memory persistent database. Security features are built into the system
from the ground up since I believe no data should ever sit unencrypted as
nearly all big data has the capability to hurt the users if released.
